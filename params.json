Because of this, and because it does no harm, and because I kind of like OSGi, this library is packaged as an OSGi bundle.\r\n\r\nThe API is meant to be as clutter-free as possbile in use: it should throw no exceptions, and it should return no nulls (instead of null it will return the empty string, empty collections and zero values for the numeric types).\r\n\r\nThe PropertySet interface defines the API of objects that forms both objects and relationships of the model.\r\n\r\nThis library is licensed under the Eclipse Public License.  See the\r\nfile LICENSE for the terms and specifics of the license.\r\n\r\n# Development stuff<a id=\"sec-2\"></a>\r\n\r\n[![img](https://travis-ci.org/steinarb/modelstore.png)](https://travis-ci.org/steinarb/modelstore) [![img](https://coveralls.io/repos/steinarb/modelstore/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/steinarb/modelstore)\r\n\r\n-   [Source code repository](https://github.com/steinarb/modelstore)\r\n-   [Continous integration build on Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/steinarb/modelstore)\r\n-   [Test coverage history on coveralls](https://coveralls.io/r/steinarb/modelstore)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
