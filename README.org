* What is this?

This is a small Java library intended to hold a model consisting of objects and relations in memory.

The main use case for this library is to be used as a generic model container for an Eclipse GEF editor.  Because of this, and because it does no harm, and because I kind of like OSGi, this library is packaged as an OSGi bundle.

The API is meant to be as clutter-free as possbile in use: it should throw no exceptions, and it should return no nulls (istead of null it will return the empty string, empty collections and zero values for the numeric types).

The PropertySet interface defines the API of objects that forms both objects and relationships of the model.
